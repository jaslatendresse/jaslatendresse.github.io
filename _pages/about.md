I am Jasmine, a Ph.D candidate in Software Engineering working under the supervision of [Emad Shihab](https://www.concordia.ca/faculty/emad-shihab.html) in the [DAS Lab](https://das.encs.concordia.ca/) at [Concordia University](https://www.concordia.ca) in Montreal, Canada. I am also part of [CREATE SE4AI](https://se4ai.org/), a training program funded by [NSERC](https://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/index_eng.asp) that aims to fill the major shortage in highly qualified personnel (HQP) that can develop, deploy and service AI-based software systems and equally provide the HQP with a solid background on ethical and social understanding of AI. 

During my undergraduate studies, I quickly learned that Software Engineering comes with a fair amount of frustration, which motivated me to start doing research; a way to find solutions to alleviate problems (and frustrations) related to software performance and maintenance. Thus, I have a strong interest in the software supply chain, software engineering for AI (SE4AI), and AI. 

I am currently working as an AI research intern at the [National Bank of Canada](https://www.nbc.ca/).
